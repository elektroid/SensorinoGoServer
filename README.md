This server is an attempt to rewrite original python server for sensorino in go

Server should act as a rest server but also connect through mqtt
A UI should be added later
Also a serial connector should make a link with "base"

It should take advantage of go binary compilation (better than to carry tons of dependances)
We want to run on raspberry and other ARM platform, will need to check perfs/compilation
